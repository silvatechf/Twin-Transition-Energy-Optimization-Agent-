## Project Overview

<img src="assets/image2.png" alt="screenshot GRC" width="50%" />

This system monitors energy usage, evaluates optimization scenarios, and generates technical recommendations.  
The architecture is cleanly separated into independent modules so the platform can scale, evolve, or integrate with external systems without major restructuring.

**Core capabilities include:**

- Real-time data ingestion and normalization  
- Simulation of optimization strategies (load shifting, peak shaving, baseline deviation, etc.)  
- Anomaly detection and alerting  
- Automated technical reporting using a generative AI service  
- REST APIs designed for integration with dashboards or external services

| Layer | Technologies | Description |
|-------|--------------|-------------|
| **Application Core** | Spring Boot 3, Java 17 | Main agent logic, REST services, process orchestration |
| **Optimization Engine** | Custom algorithms, mathematical models | Runs simulations and computes efficiency scenarios |
| **AI Analysis Layer** | Gemini API | Produces contextual summaries and recommendations |
| **Persistence Layer** | PostgreSQL, JPA | Stores historical data, results, and metrics |
| **Observability** | Spring Actuator, structured logs | Health monitoring and diagnostics |

The system follows a domain-centric structure, ensuring business rules remain isolated from infrastructure details.
